# Job Recession Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting job recessions in India using machine learning and data analysis techniques. It aims to provide insights into the correlation between economic indicators and job market downturns. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Historical economic data, including GDP growth, inflation rates, industrial production, and job market data, is collected and structured in a dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data preprocessing steps are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure proper data formatting.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations such as scatter plots and line graphs are used to understand relationships between economic indicators and recessions.

4. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - A logistic regression model is built and trained on historical data to predict job recessions.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is used for visualization.

6. **Prediction**:
   - The trained model is used to make predictions about future recessions based on provided economic indicators.

7. **Data Visualization**:
   - Additional visualizations, such as line graphs, are included to illustrate the trends of economic indicators over time.

## Getting Started
